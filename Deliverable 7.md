# Deliverable 7: Verification and Validation

## I. Description
Our system provides an auction house over the web for students to buy and sell
products for school faster and locally. Instead of visiting multiple sites
users can login with a registered account and start browsing the auction house.
If a user is not in the database they will be required to register with valid
information. Once on the main page, the user will find a search bar and options
to narrow their search via category and subcategory. If the user chooses to buy
they can either bid or choose buyout (buy now option). If the user wants to sell
then they can submit an item as an auction by providing enough details for the
item to be valid.

## II. Verification
### 1. Unit Tests

Test framework that we thought would work was the PHPUnit  
[Project Folder](https://github.com/didyousaythat/Software_Engineering_group/tree/master/Auction_House)  
[Test Example](https://github.com/tfrommen/unit-test-examples/blob/master/tests/php/FortuneTellerTest.php)

### 2. Integration Tests

Test framework that we thought would work was the PHP unit  
[Project Folder](https://github.com/didyousaythat/Software_Engineering_group/tree/master/Auction_House)  
[Test Example](https://github.com/alexnederlof/integration-testing-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/alexnederlof/inttesting/MultiBrowserTest.java) This test incorperate a unit test the author had already made, notably   
[Other test](https://github.com/alexnederlof/integration-testing-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/alexnederlof/inttesting/SlowTest.java.)
I was also unable to get the integration tests working for our project, due to issues running PHPUnit. 

### 3. Acceptance Tests

Test framework that we thought would so well was the Mocha framework for node.js  
[Project Folder](https://github.com/didyousaythat/Software_Engineering_group/tree/master/Auction_House)  
[Test Example](https://gist.github.com/fzaninotto/f13ce17fc15c532d00a4#file-gistfile1-js)

### Reflections
	
**Features that Worked Well:**
When registering for an account it checks for validation of user input
Login directs user to the main page
When a item is picked, it takes you to a description page

**Things that can be Changed:**
Get user login/register input connected to a database
Better Security for database ( only hashed passwords in the database )
Search Bar
More Categories

**Learning Curve:**
Easy to Navigate 

**User Performance:**
Yes they explored the site just as we expected.

**User’s Actions:**
Not exactly because we had trouble connecting to an online database.

**User Liked the Most:**
The look of the site and how funny the description was.
	
**Value Proposition:**
Our value proposition would have been met if we could of connected to an online database
